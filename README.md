*--WIP--*


<a href="https://erstan.github.io/prima-vista">PrimeVista</a> is a piano simulator that can be used for practicing music notation on the Grand Staff (Treble Clef and Bass Clef only). Currently, the simulator can be used to play notes in the frequency range `C2` to `B6` using the <a href="https://github.com/keithwhor/audiosynth">audiosynth</a> waveform synthesizer. A random note generator and an accuracy tracker is to be added to the project later on!
